This project is about implementing the bilateral filter and bilateral grid by **Python**, and use them to finish some image processing operators, list below:

- Edge-aware denoising (bilateral filter);
- Tone Mapping (bilateral grid);
- Style translation (won't be implement right now);

<span style="color:red">Note:</span> Due to limited time, some code is writing in a very "bad" way, the only goal here is to help me understand the algorithms more in-depth, so I'll not care the efficiency and running time (I promise try my best) too much, so If you would like to use the code in your own projects, please remember the code may not "good" enough!

If your have any furthur questions related to the code and document, please don't hesitate to shoot an [email](jundai332@gmail.com) to me!
